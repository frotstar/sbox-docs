# Glyphs

Input glyphs are an easy way to show users which buttons to press for actions, they automatically adjust for whatever device you're using and return appropriate textures.


```csharp
Texture JumpButton = Input.GetGlyph( "jump" );
```


:::info
 Glyphs can change from users rebinding keys, or switching input devices - so it's worth it just grabbing them every frame.

You can also choose between the default and outlined versions of glyphs, like so:

```csharp
Texture JumpButton = Input.GetGlyph( "jump", InputGlyphSize.Small, true );
```

To use these quickly and easily in razor, you can use the resulting texture directly in an <Image> panel:

```markup
<Image Texture="@Input.GetGlyph( "jump", InputGlyphSize.Medium, true )" />
```
